\section*{What?} 

 
 \begin{frame}
  \frametitle{\bf Bayesians can't walk on water}

 \includegraphics[width=\linewidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{water.jpg}
 
 Except maybe shallow water
\note{
  Bayesian approach cannot solve experimental design issue, e.g. wanting to find effect of competition with N=2 ...
}
  
 \end{frame}
 
 \begin{frame}
  \frametitle{\bf There is no bayesian model}
  
  \begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=.8\textheight,keepaspectratio]{bayes_model.jpg}
  \end{figure}

 
  

   \note{Bayesian data analaysis uses the same models as developed in classical stats,
   so there is no hierarchical bayesian models, but rather hierarchical models fit using a
   bayesian framework, this is pretty comforting as this means that we can continue fitting the same
   model we've been using except this time with all advantages confered by bayesian data analysis.}

  \frametitle{\bf What is Bayesian Data Analysis?}
  
    
  Posterior $\propto$ Likelihood * Prior
  
  \vspace*{1cm}
  
  Or:
  
  \vspace*{1cm}
  
  New knowledge $\propto$ new data * prior knowledge
  
  \vspace*{1cm}
  
  Bayesian data analysis updates prior knowledge (or belief) based on new data.
  
 \end{frame}
 
 
 \begin{frame}
  \frametitle{\bf The Likelihood: what we've been doing all of our lives}
  
 \[
  lm(y \sim x1 + x2, data)
 \]

  
  This is equivalent to:
  
  \[
   y_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_i,\, \sigma)   
   \]
   
   \[
    \mu_i = a + b_1 * x1 + b_2 * x2
   \]

Which is called the \textsc{likelihood}, the probability of the data given the model: Prob(data | model) 
   
  
  \note{Prob of the data knowing the parameters, what is hidden behind the (G)LM(M) motor
  
  Some plot of what this means  
  
  Good news is: we do not need to learn new models}
  
 \end{frame}
 
 \begin{frame}
  \frametitle{\bf The likelihood: a graphical example}
  
  \begin{itemize}
   \item The data: 5 out of 10 sites occupied by a species
   \item The parameter: \textbf{p} the probability of occupancy
   \item The likelihood: Prob(5 | p) = Binom(n=10, p)
  \end{itemize}

  \note{This is something new, prior is also a probability distribution that represent our beliefs of the likely values of the parameters
  This is the information that is around in the literature or in the community before doing an analysis
  Example: want to explore plant growth or whatever with a meta-analysis
  And/or information based on the nature of the parameter
  Example: a time parameter will likely be >= 0}

  \end{columns}

  \note{
  
  The posterior is also a probability distribution, it quantifies the probability of parameter values knowing the data (the likelihood) and our expectation (prior)
  The impact of the data vs the expectation depends on the sample size, with low sample size the prior is relatively more important (little information in the data), as
  sample size grows the likelihood gets more and more weights, a simple example (maybe a shiny app ...)
  % I like the idea of the shiny app, maybe using a simple example like the prop water/land in the StatRethinking book?

\section{How?}

 \begin{frame}
  \frametitle{\bf Ways to fit bayesian models in R}
  
  
  
  Two main options are available to fit bayesian models in R:
  
  \vspace{1cm}
  
  \begin{columns}
   \column{.5\textwidth}
   Directly using a dedicated probability language:
   \begin{itemize}
    \item JAGS via rjags
    \item Stan via rstan
   \end{itemize}
   
   \column{.5\textwidth}
   Using packages that translate R formulas into the probability language:
   \begin{itemize}
    \item rstanarm
    \item brms
   \end{itemize}
   With these packages one can easily do Bayesian Data Analysis without needing to learn a new language.
  \end{columns}

  
  \note{Coding in probability language vs using wrappers
  Stan is a programming language in its own so can code the models direclty in it (some snippet code example of simple model)
  Knowing this we have the full flexibility to fit any model we want but we also have the full possibility that we make coding/interpretation
  errors that are not visible.
  There are a couple of R packages to transcribe the standard R formula synthax into Stan models: rstanarm and brms. With this option we are sure that the model
  code is correct and also optimized so it will certainly run faster than naive implementation directly in Stan. But one is limited by what the package developers have
  implemented.}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{\bf MCMC sampling in real life}
  
  JAGS and Stan use different samplers, both have strength and weaknesses.
  
  \begin{figure}
   \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth,height=.4\textheight,keepaspectratio]{sampling_mcmc.png}
   \caption{Stan uses Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo sampling which can be thought as sending a satellite with some momentum to sample around earth. Michael Betancourt (2017) \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02434}}
  \end{figure}

  
  More informations on sampling in JAGS and Stan:

   \item \url{http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12681/full}
  \end{itemize}

  \note{Markov Chain Monte Carlo: stochastic transition within parameter space only based on current and proposed jump.
  Key point: at convergence the MCMC samples will equal the posterior distribution, the MCMC samples are not stricto sensu the posterior}
  
 \end{frame} 

 \begin{frame}
  \frametitle{\bf Elements of Bayesian vocabulary}
  
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Chains: number of Markov chains ran, best to have at least 3
   \item Convergence: property of the Markov chains, at convergence the MCMC samples represent the posterior distribution
   \item Divergence: property of the Markov chains, when the sampler does not effectively move in the parameter space, in Stan it specifically means that the Hamiltonian dynamics ran into that indicates potential bias in estimates.
   \item Rhat: indicator to check convergence of the Markov chains, a value of 1 indicate convergence
   \item n\_eff: number of effective samples, due to autocorrelation in the Markov chains fewer samples are taken than expected, n\_eff / number of MCMC samples should be larger than 0.1
  \end{itemize}

  
 \end{frame}
 
  \begin{frame}
  \frametitle{\bf Model checking in Bayesian data analysis}
  
  Your best friend for model checking is the \textbf{shinystan} package
  
  \begin{figure}
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=.7\textheight,keepaspectratio]{shiny.png}
  \end{figure}
  
  To be explored during the coding session

  
 \end{frame}
 
  \begin{frame}
  \frametitle{\bf Model comparison/selection}
  
  A couple of information criteria metrics should be used:
  
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item Watanabe-Akaike Information Criteria: basically the summed log likelihood over the posterior samples (predictive density) minus the effective number of parameters, better than the DIC since it uses all posterior samples instead of point estimates.
   \item Leave-One Out cross-validation: drop one data point at a time and re-estimate the predictive density, this methods is commonly used for machine learning models to avoid problems like overfitting.
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \vspace*{0.2cm}
  
  Both are readily available for Stan models through the \textbf{loo} package

  
 \end{frame}
 

\section{Why?}
 
  
 \begin{frame}
  \frametitle{\bf Difference between frequentist and bayesian inference}
  
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Frequentist approaches are based on the \textbf{likelihood} (probability of the data given the parameters) only, inference statement are based on imaginary repetition of the data collection.
   \item Bayesian approach is based on the \textbf{posterior} (probability of the model given the data and the prior), inference statement can be interpreted in terms of probability of the parameters.   
  \end{itemize}
 \end{frame}

 
  \begin{frame}
  \frametitle{\bf Embracing uncertainty}
  
  \begin{figure}
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=.7\textheight,keepaspectratio]{posterior-params.png}
  \end{figure}

  
  \note{Everything is variable, all parameters come with (posterior) distribution, can interprete posterior sample
  as probabilities, flexibility to test any hypothesis building on these}
  
 \end{frame}
 
  \begin{frame}
  \frametitle{\bf Flexibility in model building}
  
  It all comes down to the likelihood, as long as you can write down the likelihood function you can fit whatever model you want.
  
  \begin{figure}
   \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth,height=.6\textheight,keepaspectratio]{summ.png}
  \end{figure}

   \note{As long as you can write your likelihood function you can fit any model you like (similar to using MLE approach
  ie with bbmle)}
  
 \end{frame}
 
 \begin{frame}
  \frametitle{\bf Models as data storytelling}
  \begin{center}
   \calligra Once upon a time\\

  \end{center}
  
  \begin{figure}
   \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth,height=.4\textheight,keepaspectratio]{jena.jpeg}
  \end{figure}

  \begin{itemize}
   \small
   \item BDA allow great freedom in model building taking into account, if needed, sampling design, measurement processes ...
   \item Rather than squeeze your data to fit specific model assumptions, in BDA the models are adapted to the data
  \end{itemize}

  
 \end{frame}

 
  \begin{frame}
  \frametitle{\bf Bayesian approach output is what we actually want}
  
  Posterior samples from the MCMC can be interpreted as probabilities.\\
  
  \vspace*{0.3cm}
  
  It is easy and straightforward to manipulate them to get what you want (probability intervals, hypothesis tests ...) all with easy interpretation.\\
  
  \vspace*{0.3cm}
  
  Very different from complex and convoluted concepts like p-values, confidence intervals, null hypothesis ...
  
   \note{Bayesian data analysis give us relevant answers in terms of probability rather than weird answers refering to some null hypothesis in
  terms of frequency, }
  
 \end{frame}
 
  \begin{frame}
  \frametitle{\bf Asymptotic convergence, when bayesian and frequentist approach give similar answers}
  
  As sample size increase the posterior is drawn closer and closer to the likelihood, in other words at infinite sample size the posterior is the likelihood
  
  \vspace*{0.3cm}
  
  The relative importance of the likelihood vs the prior depends on the complexity of the models, if sample size is fixed, the more parameters, the more the posterior is affected by the prior
  
  \note{With infinite sample size the posterior distribution just reflect the likelihood, as sample size increases
  priors have dwindling effects}
